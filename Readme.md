 # Vimeo Video python script 
 
Vimeo Video Python script is used to download videos from Vimeo. I used to work in live production (ie live events) and needed a simple way to play videos offline. Because you don't stream video in a live production environment if not necessary. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install youtube_dl.

```bash
pip install youtube_dl
```

## Usage
